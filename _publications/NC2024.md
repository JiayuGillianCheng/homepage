In this preprint, the authors recorded intracranial EEG from epilepsy patients performing a modified flight initiation distance (FID) task to probe neural circuits underlying escape. They show that during threat assessment (“cognitive” stage), the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus encode threat level, whereas during rapid escape (“reactive” stage), the midcingulate cortex and amygdala are preferentially activated. A negative correlation between amygdala and vmPFC/hippocampal high-gamma activity under rapid attack suggests an inhibitory interplay enabling swift reactions. These findings delineate the distinct contributions of reactive and cognitive fear circuits to human escape behavior.
