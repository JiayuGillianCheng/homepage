This study examined how participants’ belief in the veracity of trial‐by‐trial feedback affects ERP indicators of concealed information detection. By manipulating belief versus disbelief in feedback validity, we observed enhanced feedback‐related negativity (FRN) and P300 amplitudes when feedback was believed, leading to improved classification accuracy in the feedback‐CIT. These results underscore the critical role of cognitive appraisal in modulating neural markers of hidden knowledge.
