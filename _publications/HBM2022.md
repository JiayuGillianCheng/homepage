We investigated how instructed mental countermeasures—designed to reduce stimulus salience—impact ERP-based detection in a feedback‐CIT that combines recognition‐P300 and feedback‐related FRN/P300 metrics. Findings show that salience‐based strategies effectively attenuate the recognition‐P300 response but do not significantly compromise FRN or feedback‐P300 amplitudes. This suggests differential susceptibility of concealed‐information markers to intentional countermeasure use.
