The feedback concealed information test (fCIT) is a novel form of the CIT, providing participants with feedback regarding their memory concealment performance. The fCIT utilizes event‐related potentials (recognition‐P300 and feedback‐related event‐related potentials) and has been shown to provide high efficiency in detecting information concealment. However, it is unclear how well the fCIT performs in the presence of mental countermeasures. To address this question, participants were trained to use countermeasures during fCIT. Results showed that the recognition‐P300 efficiency decreased when participants used countermeasures. However, the efficiencies of feedback‐related negativity and feedback‐P300 were unchanged, with feedback‐P300 still showing a high detection efficiency (AUC = 0.86) during countermeasures. These findings demonstrate the potential of fCIT for subverting countermeasures.
