We conducted two separate meta‐analyses on event‐related potentials—the N2 and medial frontal negativity (MFN)—across deception versus truth‐telling tasks. Results revealed that deceptive responses consistently evoke larger N2 amplitudes and more negative MFN deflections, indicating that lying recruits additional inhibitory and monitoring processes. These findings support theories positing that deception imposes greater cognitive control demands compared to truthful reporting.
