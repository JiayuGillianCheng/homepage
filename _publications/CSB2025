This article provides a comprehensive review of two related but distinct constructs—cognitive flexibility (the ability to shift attention and strategy in response to changing demands) and affective flexibility (the capacity to modulate emotional responses adaptively). We outline the neural circuits and neurotransmitter systems underlying each form of flexibility, summarize behavioral paradigms and neuroimaging findings, and discuss how deficits in these processes contribute to disorders such as depression, anxiety, and OCD. Finally, we propose an integrated framework for assessing flexibility in clinical settings and highlight promising intervention strategies targeting both cognitive and affective domains to promote resilience.
